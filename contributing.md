## Contributing code
If you would like to contribute code you can get started by installing npm and yarn, and running *yarn install && yarn start* in the root folder of the project. Any unassigned issues are up for grabs. Create a pull request with the changes concerning your github issue and it will be reviewed. 

## Contributing generator data
If you don't know how to code but would still like to help, you can edit the [generator data file](https://github.com/Durtur/Dungeoneer/blob/master/data/generators/names.json). As with code, create a pull request with your changes. 

## Adding sound effects
To add more sounds to the default sound library, you can add a sound to the [sound folder](https://github.com/Durtur/Dungeoneer/tree/master/app/mappingTool/sounds), and if attribution is required add that to [sound attr.js](https://github.com/Durtur/Dungeoneer/blob/master/app/sound%20attr.js). Then create a pull request, including information regarding where the sound is from.
